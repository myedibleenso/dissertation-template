\section{Overview}
\label{sec:example-overview}
%\item Explores two types of models for scientific discovery
This chapter examines ??? based on the work introduced in earlier chapters. 
I will begin by outlining a method for ??? in \citet{???}.  
The approach is built upon ??? described in Chapter~\ref{chapter:introduction}.  
%The second model describes how a citation network can be used to derive representations of research communities, which can be used to analyze and rank paths of influence relations.
%We can surface opportunities for collaboration and discovery by identifying disconnected research communities




\section{Conclusions and limitations}
\label{sec:example-conclusion}
\paragraph{Innovation 1} In this chapter I have described how ???.  
While our initial results are modest, the ???.  Results would likely improve by ???, as well as exploring ???.
