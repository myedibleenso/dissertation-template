I used and modified this LaTeX template for my dissertation based on a template shared by Wendy Herongrove.

# UA + Tufte thesis template
Tufte-esque book class for University of Arizona PhD dissertations.

This style is mostly a combination of [tufte-latex](https://ctan.org/pkg/tufte-latex) and [uathesis](https://github.com/trananh/uathesis). It has some changes to allow the Tufte style to be acceptable to the UA Grad College. For example, it is not permitted to have running headers of the thesis's and chapter's titles. (_This is terrible._) Also, I've updated the permitted copyright language to reflect that UA no longer seems to allow Creative Commons licenses. (_This is terrible._)

The _Tufte_ referenced above is [Edward Tufte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Tufte) (pronounced TOUGH-tee).
